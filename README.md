# Project03 - See below for links to relevant content. Scratch work also included in repository.
## In this project four main questions were examined through the lens of statistics. We used a European Soccer Dataset (see below) to construct four alternative hypotheses to test. 

### Our questions were:
-Is there a significant difference between the underlying distributions of the various bookies? First, is there a difference specifically between each bookie to each other (ttest) within each category (home win, away win, and draw)? Second, is there a difference between each bookie and the underlying distributions of all the other bookies (anova test)?

-Is there a statistical difference in the odds of winning a game when a team is playing in front of their home crowd?

-Is there a significant difference between the upper and lower groupings of players rated by various athletic measures vs those same players rated by various soccer skills?

-Is there a significant difference between the underlying distribution of goalkeeper skills?
